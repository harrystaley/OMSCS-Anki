# OMSCS-Anki

Study materials for courses in the Georgia Tech OMSCS (Online Master of Science in Computer Science) program.

This repo is for contributing to improve the materials. If you just want to download the Anki decks, you can find them in the [AnkiWeb Shared Decks](https://ankiweb.net/shared/byauthor/292704949) repository. 

## Loading decks

- CrowdAnki add-on – This add-on lets you import/export decks as JSON. Install it from Anki's add-on menu (code: 1788670778), then use File → CrowdAnki: Import from disk and point it to your JSON directory. Note: the JSON must follow CrowdAnki's specific schema.
- genanki (Python library) – If you're comfortable with code, you can write a script that reads your JSON and generates an .apkg file using the genanki library, then import the .apkg into Anki normally.
